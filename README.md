# Bash-Find-File-Size
A small bash script that takes in a directory from the user as input, and returns the size of each file in that directory.

#How to run the script:
1. Open a command terminal in a Linux environment
2. Download/copy the script file in the environment
3. In the terminal run the commands:
   "sudo chmod +x FileNameAndSize.sh", this makes the script executable
   "sudo ./FileNameAndSize.sh"
4. You will be prompted to enter a directory and the program will output the names of all valid files and their sizes in the terminal. If the directory is not valid, you will be told that the input is not valid.
